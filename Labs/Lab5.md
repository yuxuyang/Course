For HW3, you will add a feature for supporting import of fitbit data into iTrust, and display in a page. Get started by brainstorming and doing a rough sketch of the following with your homework partner:

* Design a wireframe model for displaying data.
* Design a flow map for describing user experience steps in importing data and displaying it.
* Select architecture styles releavant for system.
* Create a class diagram to representation the fitness data.
* Identify two design patterns that might be useful for your implementation.
