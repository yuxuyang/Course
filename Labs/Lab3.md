# Bug Hunt

Get with a partner. You may want to think about a pair that you will be working with for HW2.P1 and HW2.P2.

## Getting to Know iTrust (50 minutes)

This semester, we will be enhancing the open source iTrust health care application.

Go to http://agile.csc.ncsu.edu/iTrust/wiki/doku.php?id=requirements to find the current iTrust requirements. Take a look at the requirements document and familiarize yourself with the different roles of the application users and what functionality each user has.
We will become more familiar with iTrust by testing the application today. Launch iTrust through your lab or laptop installation.

You can also review several [use cases here](https://drive.google.com/a/ncsu.edu/folderview?id=0B_REsPCRRdhOfjdMVXp4OElqeEdiUWF5TVZaVDBmOEpwVkhiS1QyUEpVWVJDVHpoeUJYd2c&usp=sharing).

## Finding and Filling Bugs (60 minutes)

Review the bugs listed on: https://github.ncsu.edu/engr-csc326-staff/iTrust-v21/issues
Using what you know about the requirements and use cases, try to find and fill a bug on the github issue tracker.

To fill a bug, you must create a complete bug report using GitHub's Issue Tracker functionality. 
Each issue for a failure must demonstrate 1) steps to reproduce; 2) details for isolation; and 3) details for generalization. 
In addition to the bug report, include in the comments any test cases, JSP pages, or Java classes that may be relevant.
Also include the unity ID of each member working on the bug report.

We will fix one of these bugs for Homework 2 Part 2.

**IMPORTANT:** Each pair must submit *ONE* bug to the github tracker in order to get participation credit in today's lab. Please only submit one bug per pair if you've happened to find more (Share with your labmates instead!)
