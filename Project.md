# Project

For your class project, you will add a new orthopedic and physical therapy module.

## Use Cases

### UC88: Orthopedic Office Visit

##### 88.1 Preconditions

An HCP is a registered user of the iTrust Medical Records system (UC2). The iTrust HCP user has authenticated himself or herself in the iTrust Medical Records system (UC3). The patient must be a registered patient in the iTrust Medical Records system.

##### 88.2: Main Flow

* A HCP chooses to view [S2], document [S3], or edit [S4] an orthopedic office visit for an iTrust patient [S1].

##### 88.3 Sub-flows

* [S1] The HCP enters a MID [E1] or name of a patient and confirms their selection [E2].
* [S2] An non-orthopedic/non-physical therapist HCP selects an orthopedic office visit from a list of prior visits. The HCP can view (but not edit) the details of the orthopedic office visit as described in [S3]. All events are logged (UC5).
* [S3] An orthopedic or physical therapist HCP [E3] documents the following information related to an orthopedic office visit and saves the orthopedic office visit record. All events are logged (UC5). After the orthopedic office visit record is saved, the orthopedic or physical therapist HCP is sent to an overview of all recorded orthopedic office visits for the patient. The following information may be entered, but not all is required. [E4] 
	* Date of the orthopedic office visit - current date. Required.
	* Injured Limb or joint. Required.
	* X-Ray. <Image>. Optional.
	* MRI. <Image>. Optional.
	* MRI Report. Optional
	* Add a diagnosis for a patient for diseases related to musculoskeletal health. They may diagnosis a patient with one or more diseases.
	    * Anterior cruciate ligament injury (S83.5)
	    * Meniscus tear (S83.20)
	    * Rheumatoid arthritis of hand (M05.44)
	    * Chondromalacia (M94.2)
	    * Congenital pes cavus (Q66.7)
	    * Whiplash injury (S13.4)
* [S4] An orthopedic or physical therapist HCP can return to an orthopedic office visit and modify or delete the fields of the orthopedic office visit [E3]. The event is logged (UC5). After the orthopedic office visit record is saved, the orthopedic or physical therapist HCP is sent to an overview of all recorded orthopedic office visits for the patient.


##### 88.4: Alternative Flows

* [E1] The HCP types an invalid patient medical identification number and is prompted to try again.
* [E2] The patient chosen is not the desired patient. The HCP does not confirm the selection and is prompted to try again.
* [E3] An HCP without the orthopedic or physical therapist specializations are unable to create or edit an orthopedic office visit. They are prompted to create a regular office visit (UC11).
* [E4] Invalid or missing inputs are flagged and an error message appropriate to the input is printed.

### iTrust Engineering Maintenance

The following are a set of non-functional set of requirements:

* Level 1: Refactor all `Connection` and `PreparedStatement` objects in edu.ncsu.csc.itrust.dao.mysql.* to use try-with-resources instead of manually calling `close()`.
* Level 2: Upgrade Selenium to >=2.48 and upgrade failing tests. (extra 3%)
* Level 3: Create a docker image for a running deployed version of iTrust: Java, MySql, Tomcat, iTrust war deployed to tomcat. (extra 4%)
* Level 4: Create a single apt-get, homebrew, or choco package that auto installs everything needed to develop iTrust. Must be demonstrated on a clean VM. *End the install pain, once and for all*. (extra 5%)

**You cannot receive credit for a higher level without completing all levels below it.**

## Timeline

You will deliver completed use cases and engineering changes in 6 iterations.
Starting with Iteration 1, you must deliver one at least one use case by the end of each iteration. You can continue working on non-functional engineering changes until the final iteration.

##### Iteration Worksheet

At the end of each iteration, you will submit a completed iteration worksheet at the end of the iteration (include in WORKSHEET.md). This will describe the tasks completed for your use case and scenarios.

An example sheet follows:

| Deliverable   | Item/Status   |  Issues/Tasks
| ------------- | ------------  |  ------------
| Use Case      | UC88          | &nbsp;
| Scenario      | 1             |  #33, #38, #78
| Scenario      | 2             |  [Pivotal Task](https://www.pivotaltracker.com/story/show/114636091)
| Scenario      | 3             |  [Trello Card](https://trello.com/c/diA1DaMw)
| Scenario      | &nbsp;        | &nbsp;
| Unit Tests    | Complete      | testAddVisit, testEditVisit, ...
| Selenium Tests| Incomplete    | scenario1, error1,...
| Jenkins       |  Green        | &nbsp;
| Design        | Complete      | [Link to design docs]()

* Github issues in a markdown referred to as `#33` will automatically turn into links when in same repo.
* You can link to trello cards by click on share inside a card to get a link.
* You can link to pivotal stories by clicking on the first button left of ID in detail view.
* You reuse the markdown of the above table for your worksheet.
* You are free to use any design notation (including text) you desire.

##### Demo

You will create a demo screencast for your final completed delivery. Some recommendations for [creating screencasts here](https://github.com/CSC-DevOps/Course/blob/master/HW/HW0.md#screencastsdemo-gifs-guidelines).

##### Stories and Tasks

You should practice agile by breaking scenarios down into smaller stories and tasks and plan how to test, implement, and deliver those changes in a week. Because you need to deliver a use case almost every week, you might consider having tasks that separately handle different layers of system. You will find this is a common situation in an agile team. Some suggested breakdowns include:

* Design
* Reports, scrum master, planning
* Creating database tables
* Creating testing data in generator
* Creating junit tests
* Scripting selenium
* Beans
* DAO actions
* html layout and design
* JSP logic/code

Use your iteration 0 to explore issues related to feasibility and design. Like how to store an image in a database? What code might we reuse?

##### Scenarios

You will want to create a concrete version of a scenario to make testing easier. For example:

**UC88 [S3]**

> Orthopedic HCP Dr. Brooke Boes authenticates into iTrust.  Dr. Boes searches for patient Andy 
Programmer and selects the option to add a new orthopedic office visit.  She enters the following 
information:
Date: 2/29/2016
Injured Limb or Joint: Left Knee
MRI: ![Image](http://www.orthop.washington.edu/sites/default/files/Portals/21/LiveContent/9141/Images/figure2.jpg)
MRI Results: Complete tear of ACL observed. Minor meniscal tear.  
Diagosis: Anterior Cruciate Ligament injury, meniscal tear

> Dr. Boes saves the office visit and then sees the office visit in the list of prior orthopedic 
office visits for Andy Programmer.

**UC89 [S5]**
> Orthopedic HCP Dr. Brooke Boes authenticates into iTrust.  Dr. Boes searches for patient Andy Programmer and selects the option to edit a orthopedic office visit.  She adds an order for physical therapy by selecting the following information:
Physical Therapy Order: Andrea Fuller

> Dr. Boes saves the office visit and then sees the office visit in the list of prior orthopedic 
office visits for Andy Programmer. Andrea Fuller can now create an physical therapy office visit for Andy Programmer.
