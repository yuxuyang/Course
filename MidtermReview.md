### Implementation

1) Code Smells and Refactoring

A) Identify 3 code smells in `withdraw()`. For each code smell, indicate where it occurs, and why it is a code smell.
<br>
<br>
<br>

B) Identify 2 refactoring methods that might help address the identified code smells. How?
<br>
<br>
<br>

C) Identify 2 design patterns that might help improve this code snippet. Why?
<br>
<br>
<br>

```
1    public void withdraw(final Money money) {
2        if (account.getType().isPremium()) {
3            if (account.isOverdraft()) {
4                account.substract(Money.newInstance(money.getAmount() 
                                   + money.getAmount() * account.overdraftFee(),
5                        money.getCurrency()));
6            } else {
7                account.substract(Money.newInstance(money.getAmount(), money.getCurrency()));
8            }
9        } else {
10            if (account.isOverdraft()) {
11                account.substract(Money.newInstance(money.getAmount() 
                                  + money.getAmount() * account.overdraftFee(),
12                        money.getCurrency()));
13            } else {
14                account.substract(Money.newInstance(money.getAmount(), money.getCurrency()));
15            }
16        }
17
18        if( account.getType().isPremium() )
19        {
20            Money amount = Money.newInstance(money.getAmount(), money.getCurrency());
21            if (!account.isOverdraft()) 
22            {
23            	double bonusPoints = 10;
24            	if ( amount.getAmount() > 100.0) {
25             	   result += bonusPoints * 1.2;
26            	}
27            	else if ( amount.getAmount() > 500.0) {
28            	    result += bonusPoints * 1.4;
29            	}
30           }
31        }
32
33		String fullName = account.getCustomer().getFullName();
34        String accountDescription = "";
35        accountDescription += "Account: IBAN: " 
                 + account.getIban() + ", Money: " + account.getMoneyAmount()
36        return fullName + accountDescription;
37    }
```

2) Measure branch coverage of a code snippet.

  **Test suite**:
  
  * numbers(0, 0, 0, "strictly")
  * numbers(88, 42, 42, "stricter")

```Java
public int void numbers(int x,int y, int z, string mode)
{
      if( x > 87 && y < 70 )
      {
          z = 33;
      }    
      else if( z < 42 )
      {
          if( mode == "strictly" )
          {
              return 0;
          }
      }
      else
      {
          if( mode != "stricter" )
          {
              return y = z / x;
          }
      }
      return 1;
  }
```

### Analyze

1) Two developers are debating whether a Model View ViewModel (MVVM) or a Model View Controller (MVC -- An architectural pattern variant of the Observer design pattern) is more appropriate for a data-entry heavy program with occasional visualization components. Describe some benefits of Model View ViewModel over MVC. Describe some disadvantages of MVVM.

2) Two developers are debating about what type of configuration management to use in their organization: traditional or modern. Provide two advantages of traditional CM and two limitations. Provide two advantages of modern CM and two limitations.
